Hey there! <br/>
I’m Namitha, a developer based in Kerala, India. <br/>

I love solving everyday problems with code and building things that make life easier. I’m always learning and leveling up my skills. Right now, I’m diving into Golang. <br/>

Outside of tech, I’m obsessed with Formula 1, enjoy pop music, and I’m always up for a good movie night!
